<h2 align="left">A little about me 🥷</h2>

My name is **Lucas Denner**, and I am currently studying **Computer Science**.  
Since childhood, I’ve always been passionate about technology and development — which naturally led me into the world of programming.  

I have experience working as a **Full-Stack Developer**, building complete applications from frontend to backend.  
Today, I am mainly focusing on improving my skills in **backend development**, especially using **Java + Spring Boot**.
